Mount the switch so that the actuator is beneath the little pin on the z button.
bend the pins, and solder thin wire to them, then thread the wire through the holes in the bracket and push the switch into place. After this, simply push the bracket onto the support post for the OEM z switch, and solder the wires to the extra z button pads on phob, or to the z button pads on an OEM motherboard. 

Requires minimal modification, none to the shell, only a small piece needs to be cut from the button pad for abxy. no mod needed for the z button.
